1) install mongo using brew
	- refer to "http://docs.mongodb.org/v2.2/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/"

2) start mongooose using " mongod --dbpath . " in "./db/mongodb-data" directory
	- this process is necessary server-mongoose operations

3) start mongo shell process (if desired) by typing "mongo" in seperate window to easily interface with db
	- refer to "http://docs.mongodb.org/v2.2/tutorial/getting-started-with-the-mongo-shell/" 

4) navigate to 'localhost:1337/writeBeachData' to populate db w/ one-time beach data

5) navitage to 'localhost:1337/requestBeachData' to populate db w/
real data from MSW 

(NOTE - Do this only when you want an intial population. the TEMPORARY fix implimented will request data from MSW three time staggered by two-minute intervals to ensure complete population of DB)

6) Every third hour, on minute 0, 2, 4, cron process will update data from MSW. This "triple" population every third hour is a TEMPORARY fix to ensure complete db population
