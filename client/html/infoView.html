<h3>What am I looking at?</h3>
<p>Cerfer.us provides 24 hours of the most current surf forecast data from Magic Seaweed, repackaged and animated to illustrate a map level overview.</p>
<h3>How do I read this map?</h3>
<p>Each colored circle on the map represents a beach in the MSW database.</p>
<p>The color of the beach marker represents the swell quality/power.
  <div>
    <div ng-repeat="color in colors" ng-style="{'background': '{{color}}'}" class="info-circle"></div>
  </div>
  <div> <span class="weak">weak</span><span class="strong">strong</span></div>
</p>
<p>The length, speed and orientation of the yellow vectors represent wind speed and direction. (Below is a 5mph NW wind)
  <div class="info-wind-container"></div>
</p>
<h3>What can I infer from this map?</h3>
<p>Generally speaking, if the circle is dark and wind is light and blowing off-shore, you should probably go paddle out around that vicinity.</p>
